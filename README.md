# CATch

## Description

This project involves creating a mini-game while learning the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- React Native for Web
- Webpack
- React Navigation
- Redux
- Maps JavaScript API

## How to Install and Run

Follow these steps:

1. Get a Maps JavaScript API key and replace `{KEY}` in index.html.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn run serve` to start the development server hosted by Webpack.

## How to Use This App

This mini-game is about catching a cat that has run away somewhere in Dublin city.

**Start the Game**

Press the `START GAME` button. You will see a cat running away!

**Find the Cat**

Drag the marker around the Google map and try to find a suspicious marker. The hints shown on the map will let you know if you are getting close.

**Get inside Street View and CATch!**

![c3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d395b19-3517-4915-b223-017313212930)

After you find a suspicious marker, it will take you inside Street View. Try to find the cat, and when you do, click on it to catch it!

## Tech Notes

### How Long It Took to Create This App

27 hours, including brainstorming ideas, designing the game, and implementation.

### What Was Easy?

Using basic Google Maps features was easy. The API documentation provided clear instructions and code samples.

### What Was Difficult?

The latest Maps JavaScript API does not support markers in Street View. To display the markers, I needed to use absolute positioning with CSS. I used the [Street View Tour from Team Maps](http://teammaps.com) to implement this feature. This code calculates the distance from your viewpoint to the target place and generates x and y coordinates. Then it places the cat image in Street View using those coordinates with CSS. This runs every time the viewpoint changes.

### What I Learned

Through this project, I learned the following:

- How to set up React Native for Web with Webpack.
- How to set up React Navigation and React Native for Web.
- How to use the Maps JavaScript API.

### Future Work

I would like to add the following features:

- Include other countries.
- Refine the UI design.
- Add more gaming features, such as more cat characters, a time limit to find the cat, releasing multiple cats at once, and more.
